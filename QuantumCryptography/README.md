There is a famous quantum story that spread over. Imagine Alice and Bob are secret lovers and want to share a secret message, but there's a sneaky spy (of course Alice's granny), Eve, who wants to listen in. They need a super-secret way to talk without Eve understanding. So:

<br> *Step 1: They can make a secret key with Magic Coins*
Alice and Bob each have a magic coin that can land on "Heads" (0) or "Tails" (1).
Alice flips her coin in secret and writes down a list of 0s and 1s. This is her secret key!
But Bob needs the same list, so Alice sends magic photons (tiny bits of light) to Bob.
Bob also flips his coin when receiving each photon. Sometimes he gets the right result, sometimes not.
They talk later and throw away the wrong ones. Now they have the same secret key that Eve doesn't know!

<br> *Step 2: Alice hide the Message*
Alice writes her message: "HI"
She turns each letter into a secret binary code (like a secret computer language).
H = 01001000
I = 01001001
Now, Alice mixes the secret key with her message using a special trick (called XOR).
This makes the message look like gibberish! If Eve sees it, she’ll just see random numbers.

<br> *Step 3: Bob Unhides the Message*
Bob uses the same secret key to undo the mixing.
et voilà! The original message "HI" appears!
